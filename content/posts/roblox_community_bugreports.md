Making Roblox games is fun, until you have thousands of players running into bugs - Roblox does not have a built in way for players to give feedback or report bugs.  
A good way to solve this is by allowing players to report bugs and give feedback through a Discord server. Using a Discord server has a small flaw however, it's another platform between developers and fixing the actual bugs.  

## GitHub/GitLab
Of course, not every Roblox developer uses GitHub or GitLab for their games, and that's fine. You don't have to use it.  
The reality is, tracking all of the reported bugs in Discord can become messy... The solution? A GitHub/GitLab repository (it doesn't even have to host the code for the game)  

What if you could automatically make GitHub/GitLab issues directly from feedback in your Roblox game? You could use GitHub projects to track the feedback and also plan who works on it, and when.
